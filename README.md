## Purpose

Dyslexia affects the reading ability of millions around the world, making digital content extremely strenuous to access.  
**READefine** is a Chrome extension designed to improve the digital reading experience for dyslexic readers by offering customizable, clean and accessible formatting.

---

## Target Users

While READefine is primarily designed for users with dyslexia, it also benefits:

- Students working through dense reading materials
- Professionals seeking reduced eye strain
- Parents/educators supporting dyslexic readers
- Neurodivergent individuals (ex: ADHD, autism)
- Users with visual impairments or poor eyesight

---

## What is Dyslexia?

Dyslexia is a **language-based learning difference** that affects reading, writing, and spelling, unrelated to intelligence or vision.  
Symptoms include:

- Difficulty decoding words  
- Lack of reading fluency  
- Poor spelling and writing  
- Reduced phonological awareness  

**Note-->** Dyslexia exists on a spectrum; symptoms vary in severity from person to person.

## Existing Solutions and Their Gaps

### 1. **OpenDyslexic Font**
While popular, studies (ex: Rello & Baeza-Yates, 2013) show:

- No significant improvement in reading speed or accuracy  
- Some users found the shapes distracting  
- Font preferences are personal - no one-size-fits-all

### 2. **Existing Extensions**
Current Chrome extensions often:

- Rely solely on OpenDyslexic font  
- Offer limited, cluttered features  
- Are paid or lack accessibility options

**READefine** solves this by combining diverse accessibility features into a **free**, **open-source** and **user-friendly** interface.

- Support **text-to-speech**
- Stay **free and open-source**

---

## Technical Architecture

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - UI structure  
- **CSS3** - Styling and themes

### Chrome Extension Structure

| File             | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| `manifest.json`  | Metadata & permissions |
| `popup.html`     | Extension UI layout |
| `popup.js`       | Main UI logic |
| `background.js`  | Persistent background operations |
| `content.js`     | Handles mirror assist logic |
| `popup.css`      | Popup styling |
| `styles.css`     | Overlay and theme styling |

---

## Limitations

- Syllable splitting uses **basic regex**, not linguistic parsing  
- Uses **native Web Speech API** - convenient but not fully reliable  
- **Limited themes** - intentional to avoid overwhelming users

---

## Future Integrations

- PDF support  
- Mobile browser version  
- AI-powered text summarization  
- More support for other conditions (ex: ADHD, dysgraphia)  
- NLP for smarter, context-aware processing
